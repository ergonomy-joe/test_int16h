Here is what are the return value for the numerical pad on a Tandy 1000:
  
with numlock off and on
```
+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+-----+-----+
| 475C| 487E| 4900|   | 4737| 4838| 4939|
|  7  |  8  |  9  |   |  7  |  8  |  9  |
+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+-----+-----+
| 4B7C| F300| F400|   | 4B34| 5C35| 4D36|
|  4  |  5  |  6  |   |  4  |  5  |  6  |
+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+-----+-----+
| 4F00| 5060| 5100|   | 4F31| 5032| 5133|
|  1  |  2  |  3  |   |  1  |  2  |  3  |
+-----+-----+-----+   +-----+-----+-----+
```
  
and now the arrow pad:  
  
without and with shift  
```
      +-----+              +-----+ 
      | 4800|              | 8500|
      |     |              |     |  
+-----+-----+-----+  +-----+-----+-----+  
| 4B00| 5000| 4D00|  | 8700| 8600| 8800|  
|     |     |     |  |     |     |     |
